            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi! I'm a rising junior at
              <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bowdoin College</a> in Brunswick, Maine,
              majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics and minoring in psychology.
              I am broadly interested in the intersections of computation, language, and cognition,
              and am currently most passionate about advances in multimodal Natural Language Processing (NLP).
              As a Gibbons Research Fellow with the Lexicon Lab at Bowdoin, I investigated age-related differences
              in semantic fluency using computational modeling, which culminated in a poster presentation at the
              Psychonomic Society's Annual Conference in New York. I lead the Quiz Bowl team at Bowdoin and work
              at the Baldwin Center for Learning and Teaching as a Learning Assistant and Quantitative Tutor.

                  <h3>Sign Language NLP</h3>
                  <p> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Word2vec </a> transformed
                    NLP by introducing a method to learn semantically meaningful word embeddings from large text corpora,
                      and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speech2vec</a> proved that
                      embeddings for spoken language could be even richer by incorporating features like tone and prosody.
                    Could we extend this idea to sign language? I am currently working with Professor
                      <a href="https://jeovafarias.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeov√° Farias</a>
                      to create a sign language embedding model that leverages specialized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
                    to learn rich, expressive, and interpretable embeddings from sign language videos.</p>

                  <h3>Modeling Search in the Mental Lexicon</h3>
                  <p> How do we search for words in our brain? Does it change as we age? I worked with Professor
                      <a href="https://abhilashak.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abhilasha Kumar</a> at the
                      <a href="https://thelexiconlab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lexicon Lab</a> at Bowdoin
                        to investigate lexical retrieval using computational modeling. We used the
                    <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2012-03839-001.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimal foraging</a>
                       model of semantic search to elucidate age-related differences in lexical retrieval, demonstrating that

                      <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2015-03426-001.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">random walk</a>

                    and the Lexicon Lab at Bowdoin to investigate age-related differences in semantic fluency using computational modeling.
                    We used a random walk model on a semantic network constructed from human word association data to simulate the
                    semantic fluency task, in which participants name as many items as possible from a given category (e.g., animals) in a limited time.
                    Our model was able to replicate key patterns observed in human data, such as the number of words produced and the clustering of related words,
                    and we found that older adults' performance could be explained by a smaller and less connected semantic network.
                    This work culminated in a poster presentation at the Psychonomic Society's Annual Conference in New York.</p>
